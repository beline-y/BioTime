Routes were then distributed to State Coordinators. These roadside routes were then groundtruthed to determine suitability (not too dangerous, not too noisy to hear) and stop placement. There were 10 stops per route, at least 0.5 miles apart, and located in/near wetland habitats. The wetland habitat was considered appropriate potential habitat (pond, vernal pool, roadside ditch, etc) during selection but the observed presence or absence of amphibians during or prior to selection was not used as a selection factor. Each state established three or four sampling periods to cover the calling phenology of its local species. States used three sampling periods, unless an additional period to target wood frogs was desired. The sampling periods were created to target the peak vocalization times (thereby increasing detection probability) for early-, mid- and late-season breeding amphibians and to assist observers in understanding when to collect data. States were permitted to adjust the sampling dates each year to account for an early or late arrival of the calling season. A survey should have begun 30 minutes after sunset or later, but some began before sunset. Appropriate sampling conditions are based upon wind, sky, and air temperature conditions to increase detection probability. Stops were surveyed in numerical order, in one night by one observer. We encouraged, but did not require, that one observer conduct all surveys of a route in a given year. Multiple observers were instructed to each fill out their own datasheet, separately and independently, if they surveyed routes at the same time. Observers recorded the time, sky code, and wind code, at the beginning and end of each survey to verify that the sampling conditions were met on the evening of the survey. At each stop, air temperature was recorded to verify that sampling conditions were met on the sampling night; at least eight of the 10 stops must meet temperature guidelines. Observers listened at each stop for 5 minutes, and reported each amphibian species heard calling. The 5 minute listening period had no initial waiting period. Starting in 2006, the observers also recorded the number of cars that passed during the listening period and whether the moon or moonlight was visible. The observer indicated whether background noise impaired his/her ability to hear. If there was a major noise disturbance, lasting one minute or longer, the observer broke the listening period to avoid sampling during the excessive noise. If such a time out was taken, this was noted on the datasheet. After the major disturbance ended, the observers resumed listening for the time remaining before the break.

Please note that depth reflects the maximum depth of the sea basin in the location where the birds are observed from deck. 108 voyages are retained.

SUMMARY FROM SOURCE: The data were collected from research cruises and resupply vessels in the southern Indian Ocean. The majority of the records were collected between October and March. The technique used for collection is that prescribed by the Biological Investigation of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS) Working Party on Bird Ecology. Meteorological and oceanographic data were also collected concurrently.
DESCRIPTION FROM AUTHORS: Seabird observations and related environmental data from ships either performing marine science work or taking personnel and cargo to various Antarctic stations. Incidental observations of whales and seals are also noted. Observations are typically made from the bridge out one side of the ship. All observations since the 1980s have been using same protocols - sunrise to sunset. Early projects used hourly snapshots (15 minutes observations) with remainder of hour recording observations as non-snapshot obs. More recent projects use continuous observations that allow to slice the continuous data into bins that match the early protocol.",Standardised seabird & mammal observations made from sunrise to sunset in different cruise ships.,,"This study was re-curated for version 2 of the database. RECORD REMOVALS: Removed null observation - no birds seen, Suspect observation, removed unconfirmed observations, removed observations with no species type and no taxon information in general, removed observations with no coordinates, date of sampling, or observation code information. Furthermore, removed voyage id = 89, because observations on the same area span one year only (i.e., not suitable for BioTIME, which requires at least two years of data for roughly the same area). Kept info on depth when available (multiplied by -1 as it is below water). IMPORTANT NOTE ON DEPTH: Depth is a correlate, not a determinate of seabirds at sea. As many oceanic seabirds forage well away from breeding colonies, the depth range of their foraging areas will range from 0m to the maximum depth of the ocean basin over which the birds are  flying. This maximum depth represents the value in the column “DEPTH”. TAXONOMY: Included six taxa that were not in v1: Diomedea royal albatross sp, Eudyptes chrysolophus, Eudyptes sclateri, Eudyptes pachyrhynchus, Eudyptes robustus, Eudyptula minor. Diomedea royal albatross sp is now Diomedea sp in the database. All observations at different distances from the ship (near, medium, far & unreported) were pooled for any give date & voyage, since all birds were consistently recorded at all distances when seen.

Zooplankton for EMP are sampled in 3 different size ranges: microzooplankton are sampled using a pump, mesozooplankton are sampled using a modified Clarke-Bumpus net, and macrozooplankton are sampled using a mysid net. All EMP zooplankton are collected monthly at fixed stations year-round in open channels at high slack tide and preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Macrozooplankton and Mesozooplankton are collected using 10-minute oblique tows with a 124 cm long net with 505 µm mesh, and a 73 cm long net with 160 µm mesh, respectively. Prior to 1974, macrozooplankton were sampled with a 930 µm mesh net. Microzooplankton are collected with a Teel marine pump while the intake hose is raised through the water column and pumped into a net with 43 µm mesh. Pump samples collected approximately 1.5 - 1.9 L from 1972  2007, and 75 L from 2008 - present, measured by a digital flowmeter connected to the hose.
Microzooplankton samples are passed through a 154 µm mesh sieve nested on top of a 43 µm mesh sieve in the lab, and only the smaller size fraction that passes through the larger sieve and is retained on the smaller sieve is counted. Lengths are recorded for macrozooplankton (but not included in this dataset), and biomass is estimated by length-weight equations for macrozooplankton and by average values for mesozooplankton and microzooplankton (biomass_mesomicro.csv).","Stations were sampled several times a year.

Despite some changes in field protocols and sampling site locations over time, the ASPE database offers a unique set of 47,869 georeferenced and standardised sampling surveys. Fish individuals are identified to species, measured and weighted.” Though preferentially focused on fishes, the surveys also report crayfish data.” [Extracted from the abstract of Irz et al., 2022]
The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022] 
Additional: The original dataset was split into 12 datasets each with a unique consistent methodology. In each resulting dataset, the survey methods and survey strategy are consistent across sites. The same site might appear across resulting datasets if the location was monitored with different methodologies. Grain size is the average area sampled across the sites in each resulting dataset (in m2).  Abundance units= n ind/100m2, Biomass units=weights in g/100m2.","Electrofishing surveys in mainland France &amp; Corsica. This dataset contains surveys monitored with: complete sampling single or multi pass, on foot.",,"Data tables containing information relevant to the BioTIME template were merged using the ASPE Database package. Species-specific surveys were removed, and sampling points only surveyed one year were also removed. Info on day, month and year of sampling was extracted from “ope_date” (operation date). Data records were checked to be mainly diurnal surveys, with only a small proportion of nocturnal sampling events which were kept. Records with “mop_libelle”==NA were removed. Geographical data projections EPSG:2154 & EPSG:27572 were converted to WGS 84. All location coordinates were checked to fall within mainland France & Corsica as indicated in the data source. A few records (31 sampling points) with coordinates falling in random locations in Africa were removed. Values of sampling point elevation were included when available. The values of area sampled (ope_surface_calculee) for each operation were checked. All taxa records for a given operation had the same value of area sampled assigned. When operations had an area sampled=0 or NA, records were removed due to the impossibility of calculating densities. After this step, a few sampling points monitored with the same methodology only 1 year were further removed. Tables containing taxa abundances and biomasses were added. There were no NAs or 0s in the number of individuals sampled. Thus, number of individuals were aggregated per sampling point, sampling operation and taxon and divided by surface area x 100 to obtain density of individuals /100m2. When biomass (weight in g) data were available for all individuals of a taxon sampled in one sampling point and operation, these values were included. These data were also divided by surface area x 100m2 to standardise the “Abundance” and “Biomass” variables to the same scale. There were approx. 40% of sampling surveys (i.e., operations, ope_id) for which biomasses were not available (NA or 0). In these cases, Biomass is always NA. Taxonomic nomenclature was standardised to the BioTIME guideline: “sp.” and “spp” to “sp”, “Alosa fallax rhodanensis” to “Alosa fallax”, ""Carassius auratus auratus"" to “Carassius auratus”, “Salmo trutta lacustris” to “Salmo trutta”, ""Hybride brème-gardon"" to ""Cyprinidae sp1” and ""Petromyzontidae (famille)"" to ""Petromyzontidae”. We corrected “Atherinapresbyter” to “Atherina presbyter” and updated “Gymnocephalus cernuus” to “""Gymnocephalus cernua"" and ""Leuciscus cephalus"" to ""Squalius cephalus"". We populated the BioTIME family column with the records containing Family classifications (""Astacidea"", ""Cyprinidae"", ""Mugilidae"", ""Petromyzontidae"", ""Salmonidae""). The difference in area sampled for one sampling point across time was checked (the maximum value was 0.26 km2). SampleDescription (i.e., sampling event) is: pop.id(Sampling point)_ope.id(Operation/Survey id) where pop.id contains the geographic and ope_id contains the temporal info of the sampling event. Each time series in the dataset had one of 12 unique electrofishing methodologies associated (i.e., concatenation of pro.libelle & mop.libelle, see curation script) and thus the final dataset was split into 12 studies.

The plot network extends from the coast to the Cascades in western Oregon and Washington and east to ponderosa pine forests in the Oregon Cascades. Most of the permanent plots were established during two intervals: from 1910 to 1948. and from 1970 to 1989. The earlier plots were established by U.S. Forest Service researchers to quantify timber growth in young stands of important commercial species and to help answer other applied forestry questions.

A broader set of objectives motivated plot establishment since 1970. especially quantification of composition. structure. and population and ecosystem dynamics of natural forests. Plots have one of three spatial arrangements: (1) contiguous rectangles subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; (2) circular plots subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; and (3) circular plots systematically located on long transects to sample an entire watershed. ridge. or reserve. Rectangular study areas are mostly 1.0 ha or 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) in size (slope-corrected). Circular plots are 0.1 ha (0.247 ac). not corrected for slope. The tree stratum is the focus of work in closed-forest study areas. All trees larger than a minimum diameter (5 cm for most areas) are permanently tagged. Plots are censused every 5 or 6 years. Attributes measured or assessed at each census include tree diameter. tree vigor. and the condition of the crown and stem. The same attributes are recorded for trees (ingrowth) that have exceeded the minimum diameter since the previous census. In many plots tree locations are surveyed to provide a plot-specific x-y location. A mortality assessment is done for trees that have died since the previous census. The assessment characterizes rooting. stem. and crown condition. obvious signs of distress or disturbance. and the apparent predisposing and proximate causes of tree death. ____ Experimental Design - TV010: Description: The sites were selected subjectively to represent modal examples of the major habitat types in the H.J. Andrews area (usually with a mature and old growth example). Some stands (e.g.riparian) were selected for other reasons. The stands are remeasured at 5 to 10 year intervals to provide growth and regeneration information.Field Methods - TV010 : Description: The stands are surveyed into 25 X 25 slope corrected subplots marked with permanent stakes. All trees greater than the minimum size (usually 5 cm dbh) are tagged. diametered. vigor coded. and mapped. The mapping is done using a 5 X 5 m grid formed with string as a guide.

The summer RV survey follows a stratified random sampling design (Halliday and Kohler 1971). and includes both hydrographic sampling and sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl.The bottom trawl survey was originally planned to provide biomass and abundance trends for groundfish residing at depths from about 50 m to 400 m. and was extended to cover depths down to 750 m in 1999.There were changes to the net used and the vessel conducting the survey in 1982 and 1983. From 1970 ? 1981 the RV A.T. Cameron. a side-trawler using the Yankee 36 trawl. was used for the survey. In 1982. the RV Lady Hammond was used. towing a Western IIA trawl. Since 1983. the Alfred Needler has been the primary survey vessel. and the Western IIA trawl has been used in all years. Conversion factors were calculated for net and vessel changes (Fanning 1985).For long-term averages. the most appropriate starting point has been selected for each species. In the case of white hake. biomass plots start in 1970 but the abundance index data only go back to 1982. For silver hake. biomass plots and abundance index data are used starting in 1982. This is in conjunction with the change in the type of trawl. from a Yankee 36 to a Western IIA. as well as more consistent identification of white hake and red hake.In 2010. additional survey tows were completed in deeper water off the shelf edge (750 ? 1.800 m) to investigate species composition and biomass in deeper waters. Catches from these stations are not included in the biomass index estimates. to ensure that comparability with other years is maintained. Distribution plots are included here only for the most abundant species noted at these depths. Tables of the entire catches at these depths are also presented.The survey area has been divided into three zones. based on oceanography and biogeography. Trends are shown for the entire shelf survey area. and also for three separate regions: eastern Scotian Shelf (4VW; strata 440 - 466). western Scotian Shelf (4X East; strata 470 - 481). and Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy (4X West; strata 482 - 495). Differences in patterns of fish abundance and species composition are apparent for these regions during the survey. Strata 496 - 498 (the shelf edge; 350 m ? 750 m) have been sampled in most years since 1996. while strata 501 - 505 (750 m ? 1.800 m) have not previously been sampled as part of the stratified random survey series. These depths are considered separate biogeographic zones and since they have not been sampled in all years. are not included in the long-term biomass index estimates.Plots of the size and distribution of catches are provided for selected species and stratified average catches are compared with past results to provide a general overview of trends in abundance and biomass. For select commercial species where individual fish weights have been collected throughout most of the time series. trends in condition (Fulton?s K: weight/length3) are also included (Ricker 1975).Data are presented for the major commercial species. for species that comprise a large part of the survey catch. and for species where the 2010 catch was either unusually high or low (see also DFO 2011a). The set of species examined to determine if catches in 2010 were unusual was restricted to those where the area occupied exceeded 7.000 square nautical miles (approximately 1/7th of the surveyed area) in 2010. or averaged greater 2 than this in the 1970s. the 1980s or the 1990s. The species examined were restricted in this manner to avoid rare species for which catches display high inter-annual variability.Comparisons of stratified length frequencies for 2009 and 2010 to the long-term mean are also included for major commercial fish species. These data were summarized to assist in reviewing trends in abundance that are directly relevant to fisheries management when they are developing advice on allowable catch; hence. these data are grouped by the applicable stock management areas for each species.

A GPS unit on the surface tow vessel records the trackline over which the divers. and recording cameras. are being towed. so that the results that are later generated by analysis of the digital videos can be linked to geographic position.    A complete towboard survey is 50 minutes in length. and covers close to 2 miles of reef.Analysis of Towboard Benthic VideotapesUsing computer-assisted technology. the images captured by the downward-pointed camera of the benthic habitat are quantified as percent cover of the principle components that can be recognized from the videotapes. These components include: live coral. unencrusted (recently dead) coral. macroalgae. turf algae. coralline algae. other invertebrates. sand. rock. pavement. and rubble.The suite of corals that can be identified from the videotapes depends upon the assemblage of corals present in the area being surveyed (e.g.. the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are less speciose than the U.S. Line & Phoenix Islands). and in general is limited to the genus level of identification. Similarly. algae can typically be identified from the videotapes only according to their functional class (macro. turf. coralline).Thus. while towed diver surveys are capable of assessing large areas of reef. it requires more stationary divers working at smaller spatial scales during REA surveys to achieve a higher degree of taxonomic resolution.

This means that all main habitats are surveyed in a representative manner.
Timing and frequency: The survey should be carried out in the main breeding season for the majority of species. Hence the date for the survey will vary across the country (approximately 20 May-5 July). Start time should be 04:00 (+/-30 min), but no earlier than 30 minutes before sunrise. Each route should ideally be surveyed once per year, but each year there are routes that were not surveyed. These are prioritised the following year.
General layout: A fixed route consists of eight 1km-line transects and eight 5minute-points, along a 2 by 2 km square. Line transects and points should be considered as two separate surveys. (NOTE: some routes consist of less than eight lines and/or points. This is the case when lines/points end up e.g. in a lake or the sea due routes being distributed in a standardised grid. However, a particular route has the same number of lines and points each year it is surveyed.)
A given animal can occur on one point and one line, but double-counting the same animal on two points or two lines should be avoided. All birds (excluding young of the year) and mammals (including young of the year, but see the species list) seen or heard are registered no matter how near or far from the line or point they are.
Line transects: Counting is carried out while slowly walking, stopping to listen and watch as necessary, during approximately 30-40 minutes per km depending on the terrain.
Point counts: Birds are counted while standing still for 5 minutes at each point.
    The data shown in this Darwin core archive are, for each bird or mammal species, the sum of all individuals on all the line transects during this visit.
    The coordinates supplied are for the central point of each 25 x 25 km square of the survey grid, within which the route is situated.
    Breeding vs migrating birds: The survey person is expected to report all birds seen or heard. This survey is carried out at the time of year when most birds have just started breeding. One can therefore assume that the very majority of birds that are registered are actually breeding, or attempting to breed, in the location where they were registered. There are however some notable exceptions. Some of the species registered do not breed in Sweden, and are instead migrating individuals; for example Brent Goose (prutgås), Greater White-fronted Goose (bläsgås) and Grey Plover (kustpipare). For some species breeding in the far north of Sweden, individuals are seen further south as they are on their way to or from the breeding grounds. Examples of such species are Bar-tailed Godwit (myrspov), Spotted Redshank (svartsnäppa) and Wood Sandpiper (grönbena). There are also reports of uncommon species that are yet to be confirmed as breeding in Sweden, but where its possible that the individual registered was actually breeding at the location. Regardless of which of the described situations applies, all data is included in the dataset, and it is the users responsibility to decide how to use the data.
    Adults vs young of the year: Some birds start breeding early enough for the young to have left the nest at the time of the survey. These young of the year are not normally included in the numbers reported, but for some species it cannot be ruled out that some are indeed included. For the three Loxia species, breeding already in late winter, young of the year definitely constitute a large part of the birds registered. Species with a security class 4 or higher (according to the Swedish species information centre (Artdatabanken)) are not shown in this dataset.

POINT COUNTS
A point count consists of one person standing in a specific location for a fixed length of time at a specific time of day, and counting all birds seen and/or heard within a specific distance (""Fixed Radius"") or as far as the eye can see (""Open Radius."")
•	CAP LTER uses 15-minute observation periods
•	Counts are completed within 4 hours of local sunrise (see provided table for sunrise time)
•	Counts are done using the ""Open Radius"" method
ADDITIONAL OBSERVERS
The primary observer may be accompanied to the point by an additional observer. However,only the observations of the primary observer should be recorded on the data sheet. To avoid any bias that would invalidate the data collected, the secondary observer should not verbalize, point out birds, or give any non-verbal cues to the primary observer (e.g., looking at a bird with binoculars is a non-verbal cue). The second observer should position itself in order to minimize disturbance to birds as well as to the primary observer. Ideally, the second observer will stand near the primary observer and slowly move around or bend down so that he/she does not obstruct the primary observer views.
•	Please note in the ""Site Condition"" section of the datasheet if an additional observer was present during the count.
•	If the secondary observer sees a species that the primary observer did not see, it may be noted in the ""Notable additional bird species"" section.
COUNT CONDITIONS
•	The first point count should be started no earlier than local sunrise. The final point count should be finished no later than 4 hours past local sunrise.
•	Do not conduct point counts in steady or heavy rain, though it is acceptable to conduct counts in light, intermittent drizzle (be sure to make note of this in the ""Precipitation"" section of the data sheet).
•	Do not conduct point counts in steady winds above 20 mph (visual cue = branches of a moderate size move, small trees in leaves begin to sway). Make a note of the wind condition in the ""Wind"" section of the datasheet.
•	In the ""Disturbance"" section, note if yes or no any type of disturbance occurred during the count, and describe the disturbance under the ""Site Condition"" section of the datasheet. A disturbance may involve disturbing you, the observer (e.g., a homeowner came and talked to you), or disturbing the birds (e.g., a cat chasing birds, garbage truck making lots of noise and flushing birds, predator flew by and flushed birds, etc.).
•	If YOU, the observer, are being disturbed during the 15-minute count period for any reason, make a note of the interruption in the ""Site Condition"" section. Time should be paused for the duration of the interruption and resumed once the interruption event is terminated. Redo the count entirely if you are unsure of the time you were disrupted for.
•	Make a note of the overall noise condition for the whole count period in the ""Noise"" section of the datasheet.
APPROACHING THE POINT and FILLING TOP OF DATASHEET
•	Park your vehicle at >40m from the bird point.
•	Approach the plot as quietly as possible to minimize disturbance to the birds present.
•	In the ""Notable additional bird species"" section, make note of any bird species flushed by the approach in case they do not return during the count.
•	Under ""Notable additional bird species"", note bird species seen/heard before and/or after the count. Bird species recorded under this section are species NOT observed during the count but observed while at the site.
•	Stand quietly at plot center for 5 minutes before starting the count. This is essential to allow any disturbance caused by the approach to settle down.
•	Use this 5-minute settle-down time to fill out the information at the top of the datasheet, set up the noise meter, and find your distance brackets (5m, 10m, 20m, 40m) with the range finder. Note that the range finder MAY be in yards. If so, the conversion of yards to meters is: 5m = 5.4yrd; 10m = 10.9yrd; 20m = 21.9yrd; 40m = 43.7yrd.
•	Record in the ""Site condition"" section any unusual circumstances around the plot, such as construction activity or flooding, or anything you noticed that have changed since your last visit. Also note presence of water (or absence of it) at sites where water is typically present such as at the riparian sites (site code starting with ""EE"", ""EN"", ""PE"", or ""PN"").
•	Record ""Site Obstruction"" as the percent of the horizon view that is blocked by something within a 20-m radius of the point. Record this every visit, even if it does not appear to have changed since your last visit. Record in 5% increments.
CONDUCTING THE COUNT
After the 5-minute settle-down period, set a watch or timer and conduct the count for 15 minutes. Rotate slowly in place and record all birds seen and/or heard. For each observation, note the following in the appropriate column of the data sheet.
Species
•	the four-letter (English name) 54th AOU Supplement (2013) alpha codes if known (see bird list code provided), or write down the complete common name.
•	If the species cannot be positively identified, use the closest taxonomic affiliation (it is better to record something as ""unknown"" rather than guessing). Make sure you look at all the ""unidentified"" code options listed on the bird list code provided to pick the most appropriate code.
Number of Individuals and Distance
•	Usually, a single individual bird will be recorded per line.
•	Only record a number greater than one on a single line if birds of the same species are observed very close together, such as a flock or family group.
•	If a mixed flock is observed, put each species on a separate line and note in the ""Notes"" column that they were part of a mixed flock.
•	Record estimated flock sizes (e.g., ""10-20"" or ""15+"") only if you cannot count them all.
•	Write the number of individuals observed in the appropriate distance columns.
•	If a bird moves during the count, record only the distance at which it was first observed.
•	Pay close attention to bird movement to avoid counting birds twice.
•	Birds such as hummingbirds should be recorded in the distance column if they are using the habitat (such as when they are observed foraging) even if they are not perched per say. However, if you see them just flying quickly by or chasing each other, then they should be recorded as FT.
Fly-Throughs (FT)
•	If a bird is seen flying through the count area below the tallest structure or vegetation, and not observed taking off or landing, record it in the ""FT"" column only, not in the distance columns.
•	See note above regarding when to record hummingbirds as FT.
•	High flying birds can be noted as a FT only if they are ""aerial screeners"" using the habitat, such as a hawk circling 100 feet overhead looking for food. Make a note if the aerial screener is flying higher than the tallest structure.
•	You may note in the ""Site Condition"" section any unusual fly-overs of birds NOT using the habitat, such as a flock of Pelicans flying above the city.
Seen (S) or Heard (H) Columns
•	Record with a check mark whether the bird was identified from sight (S) or sound (H), or both. Use caution with similar-sounding birds like Juncos and Chipping Sparrows, or with mimics and imitators, like Mockingbirds and Starlings.
Direction
•	Record the direction the bird was first observed or heard. This may mean recording a bird heard to the south (S) even though you were facing northwest (N/W) at the time.
•	Use the cardinal and mid-cardinal points of the compass (N, N/E, E, S/E, S, S/W, W, N/W) in this column.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS
•	After the count is completed and before leaving the site, review your data sheet to ensure you have filled it correctly: make sure you have a count and distance for all observations, and that the top part of your datasheet is complete.
•	Record under ""Notable additional bird species"" section ONLY birds USING THE HABITAT. This section is to record bird species seen using the habitat, but not recorded during the count.
•	Under the ""Site Condition"" section, you may note species such as Cormorants or Pelicans flying high above but NOT using the habitat.
•	Record under ""Non-bird species present"" any non-bird species observed at the site or fresh signs of non-bird species (i.e., coyote scat) at the site
•	Wear drab clothing and avoid bold patterns that might scare away some birds, or attract other ones.
•	During the count, do not ""pish"", ""squeak"", or use any other methods to encourage birds to show themselves. This would artificially inflate the bird densities recorded and invalidate the data collected. If you want to see a bird you had difficulty identifying, you can ""pish"" only after the count is completed.
•	Use the 15-minute count period effectively; do not spend precious time trying to identify a bird that is far enough so that a spotting scope would be necessary to identify the species.
•	Do not start or continue a count if personal safety is threatened in any way. Notify CAP LTER bird research group managers of any threat to safety encountered at a research plot.
•	If the full 15-minute point count survey cannot be completed entirely for any reasons (e.g. weather, time limits, safety, etc.), the count must be re-done entirely and completed at another time within the season survey window.
DATA AND COMMUNICATION
•	To minimize errors, please review and complete your data sheets within a day or so after the survey, preferably the day of the survey. In between others, make sure you did not leave any blank spaces, review all the alpha codes (if uncertain of an alpha code, verify it with the bird list code provided or write the FULL common name), complete your notes and make them concise, and preform necessary research (listen to calls and/or look at different field guides) to fill in your uncertain identification(s) when possible. The datasheets must be clear and easy to read to facilitate data entry and prevent errors.
•	All completed datasheets (reviewed for errors) must be returned to ASU within two weeks of the last survey completed during that season.
•	To facilitate communication and to aid the supervisor in tracking project progress and scheduling, make at least one entry per week on the google+ project resource page – be sure particularly to note if you surveyed all your assigned sites for the week or if you missed some (specify which ones), report interesting/unusual sightings and specify where you saw them, and report any problems (i.e., site access issues, road closures, safety concerns, scheduling issues, etc).","In a given season, each bird survey location is visited independently by three birders who count all birds seen or heard within a 15-minute window using the “Open Radius” Bird Count method",,"Name of R script: ""Warren_2022_TC.R"" FM-added latitude and longitude and plot to the missing records based on data provider survey locations.

The Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) is a consortium of State and federal agencies that has been conducting cooperative ecological investigations since the 1970s. The IEP runs over twenty long-term monitoring surveys on biological components of the Upper San Francisco Estuary. Surveys monitor phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, water quality, and many types of fish. Several fish surveys sample zooplankton concurrently, and information on zooplankton species composition and abundance can be coupled with fish diet studies. The IEP long-term surveys that monitor zooplankton are the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP; also known as the IEP zooplankton study), 20-mm Survey (20mm), Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT), Summer Townet Survey (STN), the Yolo Bypass Fisheries Monitoring Survey (not included in this integrated dataset), and the Fish Restoration Program (FRP). An overview of these programs is provided in study_metadata.csv. Locations of fixed sampling locations for surveys with fixed sampling designs are provided in stations.csv, and coordinates for every sample are provided in environment.csv. Zooplankton surveys sample 3 different size classes of zooplankton, by towing nets with different sized mesh (or in one case a pump that pumps water into a microzooplankton net).
Every IEP survey that collects zooplankton samples with a mesozooplankton net, which targets adult copepods and cladocerans, because these taxa are believed to comprise the majority of zooplankton in juvenile and adult planktivorous fish diets. Some surveys also sample with micro- or macro-zooplankton nets. Three size classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers) are targeted with a 43 µm mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 µm mesh nets, and macro zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 µm mesh nets.  
 The 20-mm survey was initiated in 1995 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to monitor postlarval-juvenile Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) distribution, abundance, and timing throughout their historical spring range in the Delta. The survey is mandated under the Endangered Species Act Biological Opinion for operation of the State and Central Valley water projects (USFWS 2019). 20-mm refers to the length of the fish targeted by the net. Zooplankton samples are collected concurrently with fish samples to monitor Delta Smelt food supply. Between 41 and 55 stations have been sampled each year since the survey began.
Zooplankton are sampled twice per month between March and July at fixed stations in open channels. Mesozooplankton are sampled using 10-minute stepped-oblique tows with a 73 cm long 160 µm mesh modified Clarke-Bumpus net. The net is attached to the top of the 20-mm net frame and a flowmeter is mounted in the mouth. Samples are preserved in 10% formalin. Lengths are not recorded, and biomass is estimated by literature values. Recorded environmental variables include times, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface temperature, Secchi depth, and turbidity.
More information on the 20-mm survey and its methods can be found on the 20-mm survey website (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2021). ","Stations were sampled several times a year.

The summer RV survey follows a stratified random sampling design (Halliday and Kohler 1971). and includes both hydrographic sampling and sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl.The bottom trawl survey was originally planned to provide biomass and abundance trends for groundfish residing at depths from about 50 m to 400 m. and was extended to cover depths down to 750 m in 1999.There were changes to the net used and the vessel conducting the survey in 1982 and 1983. From 1970 ? 1981 the RV A.T. Cameron. a side-trawler using the Yankee 36 trawl. was used for the survey. In 1982. the RV Lady Hammond was used. towing a Western IIA trawl. Since 1983. the Alfred Needler has been the primary survey vessel. and the Western IIA trawl has been used in all years. Conversion factors were calculated for net and vessel changes (Fanning 1985).For long-term averages. the most appropriate starting point has been selected for each species. In the case of white hake. biomass plots start in 1970 but the abundance index data only go back to 1982. For silver hake. biomass plots and abundance index data are used starting in 1982. This is in conjunction with the change in the type of trawl. from a Yankee 36 to a Western IIA. as well as more consistent identification of white hake and red hake.In 2010. additional survey tows were completed in deeper water off the shelf edge (750 ? 1.800 m) to investigate species composition and biomass in deeper waters. Catches from these stations are not included in the biomass index estimates. to ensure that comparability with other years is maintained. Distribution plots are included here only for the most abundant species noted at these depths. Tables of the entire catches at these depths are also presented.The survey area has been divided into three zones. based on oceanography and biogeography. Trends are shown for the entire shelf survey area. and also for three separate regions: eastern Scotian Shelf (4VW; strata 440 - 466). western Scotian Shelf (4X East; strata 470 - 481). and Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy (4X West; strata 482 - 495). Differences in patterns of fish abundance and species composition are apparent for these regions during the survey. Strata 496 - 498 (the shelf edge; 350 m ? 750 m) have been sampled in most years since 1996. while strata 501 - 505 (750 m ? 1.800 m) have not previously been sampled as part of the stratified random survey series. These depths are considered separate biogeographic zones and since they have not been sampled in all years. are not included in the long-term biomass index estimates.Plots of the size and distribution of catches are provided for selected species and stratified average catches are compared with past results to provide a general overview of trends in abundance and biomass. For select commercial species where individual fish weights have been collected throughout most of the time series. trends in condition (Fulton?s K: weight/length3) are also included (Ricker 1975).Data are presented for the major commercial species. for species that comprise a large part of the survey catch. and for species where the 2010 catch was either unusually high or low (see also DFO 2011a). The set of species examined to determine if catches in 2010 were unusual was restricted to those where the area occupied exceeded 7.000 square nautical miles (approximately 1/7th of the surveyed area) in 2010. or averaged greater 2 than this in the 1970s. the 1980s or the 1990s. The species examined were restricted in this manner to avoid rare species for which catches display high inter-annual variability.Comparisons of stratified length frequencies for 2009 and 2010 to the long-term mean are also included for major commercial fish species. These data were summarized to assist in reviewing trends in abundance that are directly relevant to fisheries management when they are developing advice on allowable catch; hence. these data are grouped by the applicable stock management areas for each species.

For the survey. we used a Nephrops bottom trawl towed over the bottom during 5 minutes at a speed of approximately 2 knots.

The main site used was Shackelton Point. Because one site (Billington Bay) was only sampled some years, it is not included in the weekly average table. This table averages data taken from five sites (Shackelton Point, Buoy 109, 117 and 125, and Three Mile Bay) collected during the same sampling week. Sampling week is identified with a number that in most cases is the same as the week number of the year. On a small number of occasions, a sampling was conducted on a Friday to Sunday for the following week. The net used was a 153-um mesh nylon net (0.5 m diameter) towed vertically from approximately 1 m off the sediment surface to the water surface. The efficiency of the net was measured with flow meters from 1999 to present. If flow meter readings indicate a malfunction or human error (efficiencies below 50% and above 125%) and when no flow meter was used, we assumed an efficiency of 87.4% (average of the 1999 to 2010 sampling period 87.4% SD 9.5%, N=1655). Flow meters were calibrated each year. When flow meters were not available, volume strained was calculated as [Vol Strained] = [Tow Depth] * pi()*0.25^2*0.874. Samples were preserved in 8 % sugar-formalin solution (1964-1996) or 70 % ethyl alcohol (1997-present). Samples are stored at the Cornell Biological Field Station.
Crustacean zooplankton were counted (1964-1974) and counted and measured (1975-end of data series) using a dissecting microscope (1964-1982), a touch screen-caliper setup with computer-assisted plankton analysis system (1983-1997) (WSAM, Hambright and Fridman 1994) or a digitizing tablet and microscope (1998-end of the data series). For each sample, a 1-mL sub-sample was drawn with a calibrated Hensen-Stempel pipette or large-bore calibrated automatic pipette and all crustaceans counted and measured (since 1975). Additional sub-samples were drawn until a minimum of 100 animals were counted and measured from each sample. From 1964 to 1979, three such subsamples were counted and averaged. Gamble et al. (2006) compiled the data from 1975 to 1997 for a study on biomass size spectrum and re-measured historic samples from 1975 when only Daphnia were measured. Unrealistic length measurements sometimes substantially (for small cladocerans) outside accepted maximum lengths occurred on a small number of occasions and were assumed to be in error. They were replaced by the modal length for small cladocerans and the maximum accepted length for other species [25 of 39398 Bosmina, 146 of 28882 Chydorus, 16 of 7035 Diaphanosoma, 8 of 22767 Eubosmina, 4 of 77932 Diacyclops and 82 of 61208 nauplii] Biomass for individual species was calculated using length-weight regressions based mainly on Bottrell et al. (1976) and summarized in Watkins et al. (2011). Length-weight parameters are included in the taxa table. For years without length measurements (1964 to 1974 and 1978), the biomass is estimated from the average weight of the species or species group calculated for the time period 1975 to 1981 and given in the taxa table. Taxonomic detail varies over time. For the period 1964 to 1974 all crustacean were categorized in 10 species groups: Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Chydorus, Daphnia pulicaria, D. mendotae, D. retrocurva, Leptodora, Diaphanosoma, calanoid copepods and cyclopoid copepods. Nauplii were excluded in 1964-74. Information on the taxonomic details is in the taxa table. Copepod nauplii were counted since 1975 but not identified to group. Nauplii are underestimated due to the large mesh size (153µm). Rotifers and zebra mussel veligers are not included in this data set.

Day, month and year of sampling were obtained from “Date”. All coordinates were converted from the original projection (KKJ) to WGS 84, rounded to two decimals and checked to appear in the correct geographical locations. A guide of equivalences between common Finnish names and latin names was used to standardize taxonomic names. A few common names not included in the guide were researched and subtituted with their scientific name equivalent: ""Kirjolohi"" to ""Oncorhynchus mykiss"", ""Kolmipiikki"" to ""Gasterosteus aculeatus"", ""Nahkiainen.sp..toukka."" to ""Lampetra sp"", ""Turpa"" to ""Squalius cephalus"".

Species name ids referring to age classes of Salmo trutta and Salmo salar were removed so that abundance records would be pooled by species and not age classes later on. It was checked that sampling area was never NA or 0. Abundances were standardized by sampling area dividing number of individuals observed by area sampled and multiplying by 100 (i.e. ind/100m2, same units as in RiverFishTimeFinland2022DATA.csv).

At each sampling event, a pantograph was used to record the location and perimeter of living plants within permanent quadrats. Basal area was recorded for perennial grass species, canopy cover area was recorded for shrub species, and all other perennial species were recorded as point data. The data set includes 122 of 1 m2 of  permanent quadrats, although not all quadrats were sampled in each year of the study and there is a gap in monitoring from 19801995. Sometimes quadrats were organized in linear series at the time of establishment (e.g. A1, A2, A3, etc.), with members of a series placed at 1?2 or 1-mile intervals radiating out from a livestock watering point (Nelson, 1934). Quadrats were mapped annually from 19151947. From 19471979 a subset of the quadrats was sampled at irregular intervals. In 1995, quadrats were relocated and sampling resumed at 5- or 6-year intervals. Ongoing sampling (1995present) occurs between September and March. Historical sampling (pre-1995) was typically conducted SeptemberMarch as well, although there are exceptions. To account for the fact that a single sampling event often spanned several months, we include in the data table a column for project_year” as well as actual month and year of the sample, so that data can be grouped appropriately. For example, the 1937 sampling event data was collected from October 1937 to March 1938, and so these data are labeled with project_year = 1937. In a small number of instances during the early years of the project, quadrats were sampled twice within a year. This was done in order to capture differences in vegetation at different points during the growing season, or to investigate the effect of an extreme event (e.g. extra sampling was performed in 1935 associated with an extreme drought). Information on dates each quadrat was sampled is contained in Jornada_quadrat_sampling_dates.csv. Soil sampling was performed only once for each quadrat. Most soil samples were taken and depth measurements made in October 2001. In February 2020 samples were taken to fill data gaps in the 2001 data. The data points added in 2020 are: particle size analysis for quadrats AR2, H3, L3, L4, and Y7; depth to petrocalcic measurement for quadrats L3, L4, V1, Y7.",Annual sampling in a total of 122 quadrats.

We decided to keep these as some of the 1's were of very abundant species (ie <500 individuals). While the authors refer to ""permanent"" quadrat, there are no individual coordinates for these. Instead, we were given a set of general coordinates for the sampling area as a whole. GPS location information has been removed to protect the locations of the quadrats, however, coordinates of quadrats can be obtained by request from the data manager. Nevertheless, given that quadrats were permanent, we can use site to identify plot. Finally, some genus (n=18) were labelled with a code (eg UNKAF2).

Despite some changes in field protocols and sampling site locations over time, the ASPE database offers a unique set of 47,869 georeferenced and standardised sampling surveys. Fish individuals are identified to species, measured and weighted.” Though preferentially focused on fishes, the surveys also report crayfish data.” [Extracted from the abstract of Irz et al., 2022]
The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022] 
Additional: The original dataset was split into 12 datasets each with a unique consistent methodology. In each resulting dataset, the survey methods and survey strategy are consistent across sites. The same site might appear across resulting datasets if the location was monitored with different methodologies.

This dataset contains surveys monitored with: Systematic point sampling, on foot.",,"Data tables containing information relevant to the BioTIME template were merged using the ASPE Database package. Species-specific surveys were removed, and sampling points only surveyed one year were also removed. Info on day, month and year of sampling was extracted from “ope_date” (operation date). Data records were checked to be mainly diurnal surveys, with only a small proportion of nocturnal sampling events which were kept. Records with “mop_libelle”==NA were removed. Geographical data projections EPSG:2154 & EPSG:27572 were converted to WGS 84. All location coordinates were checked to fall within mainland France & Corsica as indicated in the data source. A few records (31 sampling points) with coordinates falling in random locations in Africa were removed. Values of sampling point elevation were included when available. The values of area sampled (ope_surface_calculee) for each operation were checked. All taxa records for a given operation had the same value of area sampled assigned. When operations had an area sampled=0 or NA, records were removed due to the impossibility of calculating densities. After this step, a few sampling points monitored with the same methodology only 1 year were further removed. Tables containing taxa abundances and biomasses were added. There were no NAs or 0s in the number of individuals sampled. Thus, number of individuals were aggregated per sampling point, sampling operation and taxon and divided by surface area x 100 to obtain density of individuals /100m2. When biomass (weight in g) data were available for all individuals of a taxon sampled in one sampling point and operation, these values were included. These data were also divided by surface area x 100m2 to standardise the “Abundance” and “Biomass” variables to the same scale. There were approx. 40% of sampling surveys (i.e., operations, ope_id) for which biomasses were not available (NA or 0). In these cases, Biomass is always NA. Taxonomic nomenclature was standardised to the BioTIME guideline: “sp.” and “spp” to “sp”, “Alosa fallax rhodanensis” to “Alosa fallax”, ""Carassius auratus auratus"" to “Carassius auratus”, “Salmo trutta lacustris” to “Salmo trutta”, ""Hybride brème-gardon"" to ""Cyprinidae sp1” and ""Petromyzontidae (famille)"" to ""Petromyzontidae”. We corrected “Atherinapresbyter” to “Atherina presbyter” and updated “Gymnocephalus cernuus” to “""Gymnocephalus cernua"" and ""Leuciscus cephalus"" to ""Squalius cephalus"". We populated the BioTIME family column with the records containing Family classifications (""Astacidea"", ""Cyprinidae"", ""Mugilidae"", ""Petromyzontidae"", ""Salmonidae""). The difference in area sampled for one sampling point across time was checked (the maximum value was 0.26 km2). SampleDescription (i.e., sampling event) is: pop.id(Sampling point)_ope.id(Operation/Survey id) where pop.id contains the geographic and ope_id contains the temporal info of the sampling event. Each time series in the dataset had one of 12 unique electrofishing methodologies associated (i.e., concatenation of pro.libelle & mop.libelle, see curation script) and thus the final dataset was split into 12 studies.

The route is selected so as to be reasonably representative of the ECN site and will often follow existing paths or boundaries and include areas under different management regimes. If necessary, the route should be marked out to ensure that the same route is followed on each occasion. The length of the transect will depend on local conditions but should be capable of being walked at a comfortable, even pace in 30-90 minutes and will therefore usually be 1-2 km. The transect should be divided into a maximum of 15 sections, which may be of different vegetation, structure, or management and which are used as sampling strata. The length of each section is recorded on a map, together with information on habitat types and abundant plants, especially butterfly food plants. Management operations in the vicinity of the transect are also recorded. Changes in these characteristics are noted, so as to assist in interpretation of results. 
Recording of the transect takes place weekly between 1 April and 29 September, between 10.45 and 15.45 BST. The temperature should be 13-17°C if sunshine is at least 60%, but if the temperature is above 17°C recording can be carried out in any conditions, providing that it is not raining. At northern, upland sites the appropriate upper temperature is 15°C. The use of more than one recorder would make recording easier at the peak of the season when high numbers of different species occur, or to provide cover for an absent recorder. Transects should be walked by someone with a good knowledge of the British butterfly fauna.

The Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) is a consortium of State and federal agencies that has been conducting cooperative ecological investigations since the 1970s. The IEP runs over twenty long-term monitoring surveys on biological components of the Upper San Francisco Estuary. Surveys monitor phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, water quality, and many types of fish. Several fish surveys sample zooplankton concurrently, and information on zooplankton species composition and abundance can be coupled with fish diet studies. The IEP long-term surveys that monitor zooplankton are the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP; also known as the IEP zooplankton study), 20-mm Survey (20mm), Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT), Summer Townet Survey (STN), the Yolo Bypass Fisheries Monitoring Survey (not included in this integrated dataset), and the Fish Restoration Program (FRP). An overview of these programs is provided in study_metadata.csv. Locations of fixed sampling locations for surveys with fixed sampling designs are provided in stations.csv, and coordinates for every sample are provided in environment.csv. Zooplankton surveys sample 3 different size classes of zooplankton, by towing nets with different sized mesh (or in one case a pump that pumps water into a microzooplankton net).
Every IEP survey that collects zooplankton samples with a mesozooplankton net, which targets adult copepods and cladocerans, because these taxa are believed to comprise the majority of zooplankton in juvenile and adult planktivorous fish diets. Some surveys also sample with micro- or macro-zooplankton nets. Three size classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers) are targeted with a 43 µm mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 µm mesh nets, and macro zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 µm mesh nets.  
DOP
 The Directed Outflow Project was initiated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 2017 to evaluate the effectiveness of fall outflow actions on Delta Smelt. Field sampling is paired with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring. Three random sites are chosen per region (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, the Lower Sacramento River, the Cache Slough Complex, and the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel) and time period using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified design. Samples were collected once every two weeks in 2017 and weekly thereafter. Sampling is conducted in the fall and, starting in 2019, spring and summer seasons have also been sampled. In 2017, stations were sampled in 3 additional regions: West of the Benicia Bridge, Lower San Joaquin, and Upper Sac River. At each station, sample collection is attempted at both shoal (less than or equal to 10 feet deep) and channel (greater than 10 feet deep) habitat. Channels are sampled at the surface (0.5 m deep) and, if deeper than 20 feet, also at the bottom 1/2 to 1/3 of the water column. In 2017, oblique tows were also conducted to compare with the horizontal tows.
DOP samples with meso (150 ?m) and macro (500 ?m) zooplankton nets that are each 2 m in length. In 2017, both nets were 50 cm in diameter but starting in 2018 a smaller 20 cm diameter net was used for the mesozooplankton samples. Samples are stored in 10% formalin.

Dataset methods
Continuous plankton recorder with a square aperture measuring 1.27 cm each side. The torpedo-shaped device is towed behind a ship at about 10 metres depth. Seawater and plankton enter the device through a small opening in the nose. This opening expands into a wider tunnel where the plantkon are trapped between two layers of silk and then preserved. In the laboratory, the silk layers are unrolled, cut into sections and plankton are then identified under the microscope. Formalin preserved samples identified in light microscopy.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects.

Figure 2 depicts the spatial arrangement of the sample plots in the study area. There was a total of 125 sample plots in five parallel transects. Each transect had a distance of 3000 m to the neighbouring transects; there were 25 sample plots on each transect with a distance of 500 m between neighbouring plots. In the following, the term sample plot” refers to each circular area with an observation point at the centre and a radius of 250 m; the total area of each sample plot is therefore about 20 ha. Depending on the dominant habitat type inside this circular area, the sample plots were classified to the habitat types arable”, grassland”, or forest” (see examples in the Supplementary Material: Figures S1S3). Due to access restrictions, the total number of accessible sample plots varied, but 111 sample plots were visited across all observation dates (Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials). The bird observation datasets for both campaigns are published [15,16].
During the main bird-breeding period, ornithologists with profound local species knowledge conducted bird surveys five times in each year (but only four times in 1999), with intervals of approximately 2 weeks between the surveys. Depending on the variable weather conditions and thus on the beginning of the breeding season, the surveys begun with the first arrivals of the migrant bird species and ended well after the main breeding season. These timings were decided by ornithologists, the dates of the surveys are summarized in Table S13 (Supplementary Materials). All observations were carried out according to the point-stop-count method [17], which involves the recording of individual birds by direct sight and/or hearing within 10 min at the centre of the sample plot. The plots were visited in the morning, starting between 5 and 8 a.m. and finishing not later than 1 p.m. To avoid rough systematic errors, the surveys started at different ends of transects, and the ornithologists occasionally changed which transect they observed over the years. Both bird species and the number of individuals for every detected species were recorded.” [Schultz et al., 2022]","Birds were monitored in two different time periods: 1999-2002 and 2013-2015.

STN
The Summer Townet Survey (STN) was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1959 in order to determine the relative abundance and distribution of upper estuary pelagic species, namely age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis). As with the FMWT, the STN is currently mandated by the 2019 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion (USFWS 2019) and began in response to the development of the Central Valley Project pumping plants. The Summer Townet Survey collects mesozooplankton samples from 32 historic stations and 8 supplemental stations ranging from San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista, Stockton, Cache Slough, and the Deep-Water Ship Channel. Zooplankton monitoring began in 2005 with samples collected every 2 weeks between June and August.
STN samples only mesozooplankton during their fish trawl with a net attached to the townet frame. Zooplankton samples are collected during 1 of the fish tows at each fixed station in open channels using 10-minute oblique tows. Mesozooplankton are sampled using a 73 cm long modified Clark-Bumpus net with 160 µm mesh and preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Biomass is estimated and recorded environmental variables include time, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface and bottom temperature, Secchi depth, Microcystis presence, and turbidity.
More information on STN and its methods can be found on the STN data publication (Burdi et al. 2022). ","Stations were sampled several times a year.

DOP
 The Directed Outflow Project was initiated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 2017 to evaluate the effectiveness of fall outflow actions on Delta Smelt. Field sampling is paired with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring. Three random sites are chosen per region (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, the Lower Sacramento River, the Cache Slough Complex, and the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel) and time period using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified design. Samples were collected once every two weeks in 2017 and weekly thereafter. Sampling is conducted in the fall and, starting in 2019, spring and summer seasons have also been sampled. In 2017, stations were sampled in 3 additional regions: West of the Benicia Bridge, Lower San Joaquin, and Upper Sac River. At each station, sample collection is attempted at both shoal (less than or equal to 10 feet deep) and channel (greater than 10 feet deep) habitat. Channels are sampled at the surface (0.5 m deep) and, if deeper than 20 feet, also at the bottom 1/2 to 1/3 of the water column. In 2017, oblique tows were also conducted to compare with the horizontal tows.
DOP samples with meso (150 ?m) and macro (500 ?m) zooplankton nets that are each 2 m in length. In 2017, both nets were 50 cm in diameter but starting in 2018 a smaller 20 cm diameter net was used for the mesozooplankton samples. Samples are stored in 10% formalin.

Despite some changes in field protocols and sampling site locations over time, the ASPE database offers a unique set of 47,869 georeferenced and standardised sampling surveys. Fish individuals are identified to species, measured and weighted.” Though preferentially focused on fishes, the surveys also report crayfish data.” [Extracted from the abstract of Irz et al., 2022]
The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022] 
Additional: The original dataset was split into 12 datasets each with a unique consistent methodology. In each resulting dataset, the survey methods and survey strategy are consistent across sites. The same site might appear across resulting datasets if the location was monitored with different methodologies. Grain size is the average area sampled across the sites in each resulting dataset (in m2).

This dataset contains surveys monitored with: Systematic point sampling, on boat.",,"Data tables containing information relevant to the BioTIME template were merged using the ASPE Database package. Species-specific surveys were removed, and sampling points only surveyed one year were also removed. Info on day, month and year of sampling was extracted from “ope_date” (operation date). Data records were checked to be mainly diurnal surveys, with only a small proportion of nocturnal sampling events which were kept. Records with “mop_libelle”==NA were removed. Geographical data projections EPSG:2154 & EPSG:27572 were converted to WGS 84. All location coordinates were checked to fall within mainland France & Corsica as indicated in the data source. A few records (31 sampling points) with coordinates falling in random locations in Africa were removed. Values of sampling point elevation were included when available. The values of area sampled (ope_surface_calculee) for each operation were checked. All taxa records for a given operation had the same value of area sampled assigned. When operations had an area sampled=0 or NA, records were removed due to the impossibility of calculating densities. After this step, a few sampling points monitored with the same methodology only 1 year were further removed. Tables containing taxa abundances and biomasses were added. There were no NAs or 0s in the number of individuals sampled. Thus, number of individuals were aggregated per sampling point, sampling operation and taxon and divided by surface area x 100 to obtain density of individuals /100m2. When biomass (weight in g) data were available for all individuals of a taxon sampled in one sampling point and operation, these values were included. These data were also divided by surface area x 100m2 to standardise the “Abundance” and “Biomass” variables to the same scale. There were approx. 40% of sampling surveys (i.e., operations, ope_id) for which biomasses were not available (NA or 0). In these cases, Biomass is always NA. Taxonomic nomenclature was standardised to the BioTIME guideline: “sp.” and “spp” to “sp”, “Alosa fallax rhodanensis” to “Alosa fallax”, ""Carassius auratus auratus"" to “Carassius auratus”, “Salmo trutta lacustris” to “Salmo trutta”, ""Hybride brème-gardon"" to ""Cyprinidae sp1” and ""Petromyzontidae (famille)"" to ""Petromyzontidae”. We corrected “Atherinapresbyter” to “Atherina presbyter” and updated “Gymnocephalus cernuus” to “""Gymnocephalus cernua"" and ""Leuciscus cephalus"" to ""Squalius cephalus"". We populated the BioTIME family column with the records containing Family classifications (""Astacidea"", ""Cyprinidae"", ""Mugilidae"", ""Petromyzontidae"", ""Salmonidae""). The difference in area sampled for one sampling point across time was checked (the maximum value was 0.26 km2). SampleDescription (i.e., sampling event) is: pop.id(Sampling point)_ope.id(Operation/Survey id) where pop.id contains the geographic and ope_id contains the temporal info of the sampling event. Each time series in the dataset had one of 12 unique electrofishing methodologies associated (i.e., concatenation of pro.libelle & mop.libelle, see curation script) and thus the final dataset was split into 12 studies. The methods associated are indicated in “summary methodology”, and the fields grain size, survey area, centLat and centLog contain unique information for each of the 12 studies.

Luff of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. At each site, in or adjacent to the TSS, a pitfall trapping system should be instituted to sample Carabidae (ground beetles) and the ubiquitous opilionid (Harvestmen) Mitopus morio. Adult crane- flies caught in the traps should also be retained in order to check their identification against the larvae extracted in soil cores (see separate Protocol for Tipulidae). It will be necessary to measure the length of the second femur of M. morio; this changes with altitude and latitude and may react to environmental change. All carabid beetles (not just Carabus spp.) are of interest.
Equipment
The pitfall traps are polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep (see Appendix I for supplier). A wire netting cage, made from chicken wire with a mesh size approximately 15 mm x 20 mm and approximately 70 mm high, is clipped to the rim of each trap so as to reduce the number of small mammals inadvertently caught in the traps. Each trap should have a cover which can be made cheaply from 5"" diameter plant pot saucers and galvanised wire. This helps to prevent heavy rain from flooding the traps, keeps birds from interfering, and helps in their re-location.
Location
Three transects should be selected, preferably within different vegetation types and including the TSS. Transects should not be placed where cattle have access. Ten pitfall traps should be established in each transect, with 10 m spacing between the traps. If possible, transects should be approached from different directions when attending to traps so as to avoid trampling damage to the vegetation. If trampling is having an obviously deleterious long-term effect on the vegetation, a trapline can be moved each year but returned to the original position every three years. Any movement of traplines should be recorded and information sent to the Central Co-ordination Unit.
Sampling
The traps are set out on the first Wednesday in May and are then emptied and replaced fortnightly for 13 sampling periods, until the end of October.

Aerial census was conducted yearly from 1980 to 2001, except in 2000, and data were obtained from National Parks and WWF aerial survey reports. These censuses followed standard procedures recommended in Norton-Griffiths (1978) and were analysed using Jolly's method (1969). Information from waterhole censuses were obtained from the Wildlife Environment Zimbabwe that has monitored herbivore populations from waterholes since 1973, with missing data for 1974, 19761981 and 1983. The 1997 data from waterhole census were not included in the analyses because exceptional rain fell during the count, which provided an abnormal situation where only few animals came to drink. The waterhole monitoring consisted of recording the number of animals coming to drink in yearly 24-h counts that occurred at the end of the dry season during the full moon. Although aerial census is a standard technique to monitor wildlife, and waterhole census is less common, the specific characteristic of water distribution in HNP provides a unique opportunity to count animals around artificial waterholes. In addition, aerial technique is biased towards larger species (Jachmann, 2002) with waterhole censuses providing data on even the smallest herbivores.

This means that all main habitats are surveyed in a representative manner.
Timing and frequency: The survey should be carried out in the main breeding season for the majority of species. Hence the date for the survey will vary across the country (approximately 20 May-5 July). Start time should be 04:00 (+/-30 min), but no earlier than 30 minutes before sunrise. Each route should ideally be surveyed once per year, but each year there are routes that were not surveyed. These are prioritised the following year.
General layout: A fixed route consists of eight 1km-line transects and eight 5minute-points, along a 2 by 2 km square. Line transects and points should be considered as two separate surveys. (NOTE: some routes consist of less than eight lines and/or points. This is the case when lines/points end up e.g. in a lake or the sea due routes being distributed in a standardised grid. However, a particular route has the same number of lines and points each year it is surveyed.)
A given animal can occur on one point and one line, but double-counting the same animal on two points or two lines should be avoided. All birds (excluding young of the year) and mammals (including young of the year, but see the species list) seen or heard are registered no matter how near or far from the line or point they are.
Line transects: Counting is carried out while slowly walking, stopping to listen and watch as necessary, during approximately 30-40 minutes per km depending on the terrain.
Point counts: Birds are counted while standing still for 5 minutes at each point.
    The data shown in this Darwin core archive are, for each bird or mammal species, the sum of all individuals on all the line transects during this visit.
    The coordinates supplied are for the central point of each 25 x 25 km square of the survey grid, within which the route is situated.

With more than 1900 marine mammal encounters in The Bahamas. we are providing the only comprehensive documentation of the marine mammal fauna in this part of the world. Our research is based on the use of systematic boat-based surveys for describing the distribution and habitat use of different marine mammal species. We employ photo-identification techniques for the recognition of individual whales and dolphins. and we have developed new statistical approaches for using these data to determine abundance estimates and occupancy patterns. This photographic sampling is complemented by the collection of skin and faecal samples for molecular genetic analysis. which are being used to assess levels of genetic diversity and investigate the structuring of marine mammal populations. The dataset presented here includes both marine mammal and turtle sightings. The dataset consists of 89 stranding records between 1944 and 2005. including 15 species with Cuvier?s beaked whale being the most common. Marine mammal sightings data includes 444 sightings between 1988 and 2005. including sightings reported from the public.

NOTES BioTIME Curator: the original dataset, Freshwater Fish Counts, was split into subsets each with a unique consistent methodology. In each resulting dataset, the survey methods and survey strategy are consistent across sites. The same site might appear across resulting datasets if the location was monitored with different methodologies. Grain size is the average area sampled across the sites in each resulting dataset (in m2). When the resulting study includes data from one sampling site only, study area = grain size in km2. Abundance units are always densities: n ind/100m2. This data subset contains records monitored with: seine netting and a catch depletion sampling strategy.",Seine netting and a catch depletion sampling strategy.,,"General: the curated dataset was the ""FW_Fish_Counts"", sourced from the indicated source link, and the curation steps were discussed with one of NFPD Fish Monitoring Specialists in March 2024. Species selective surveys were removed. Sites monitored only 1 year were removed. Zero catch surveys were removed. 
Methods: a few records with the following values in “SURVEY_METHOD” were removed: “NOT RECORDED”, “POISON”, “POLLUTION”, “Beam Trawl Netting 1.5m”, “DIP NETTING”, “DRAINING”, “INTAKE SCREEN SAMPLING”. These were removed since the methods were not employed through time in one given site. All electrofishing techniques (""ELECTRIC FISHING"", ""DC ELECTRIC FISHING"", ""PDC ELECTRIC FISHING"", ""AC ELECTRIC FISHING"") were classified as “SURVEY_METHOD” = ""ELECTRICFISHING"". Records with “SURVEY_STRATEGY” == ""NOT RECORDED"", were removed. Once more, sites monitored only 1 year with a unique combination of survey method and survey strategy were removed.   For survey strategies other than “single catch samples”, the number of runs for one given site was compared over time. Because, sometimes, the same site was monitored with different numbers of runs in different surveys, we standardised effort by taking the minimum number of runs per site and disregarding additional counts (e.g. if a site X was monitored with 2, 3 and 4 electrofishing runs in three different years (2000, 2001 & 2002),  we only took the abundances for the first two runs in years 2001 and 2002). This standardisation affects only catch depletion and catch depletion - part width surveys. This step involved removing additional records with abundance=0. Observed abundances were kept. These were initially given as a range (present, 1 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999, 1000 to 9999, 10000+). When “present”, observed abundance were set to 1, when a range, observed abundances set to the mean value in the range, when “10000+”, observed abundance set to 10000. Total abundances were set to be the sum of sampled individuals (with standardised runs) + observed individuals that could not be sampled. Records with “SURVEY STRATEGY”= ""CATCH PUE/T SAMPLE"" removed since information on duration of sampling necessary to standardise effort for these records was unavailable.
Taxonomy: surveys for which taxa were in general not identified (e.g., “SPECIES_NAME” == “Freshwater species”) were removed. In taxonomy: hybrids of Cyprinidae to “Cyprinidae sp1”, “Cyprinidae sp2”, “Cyprinidae sp3”, … “Cyprinidae sp14”; hybrids of Salmonidae to “Salmonidae sp1”, “Salmonidae sp2”, “Salmonidae sp3”; ""Gobius” to “Gobius sp”, “Lampetra” to “Lampetra sp”.
Coordinates: transformed from British National Grid (BNG) to WGS 84. Coordinates cross-checked & substituted by those in “FW_Fish_Sites” (otherwise multiple pairs per sampling site and some values falling in odd locations). Approx. coordinates for site ids 15492 & 22009 obtained from Google maps using the name and area info for the site, otherwise those given in the og data file fell at sea. 
Sampling Event Date: info on Day and Month was obtained from “EVENT_DATE”. 
Area: fished area as used to calculate densities (i.e., same as sampled area except for the part-width strategy surveys). Surveys for which area fished was NA (all PDC electrofishing) were removed. Surveys for which area fished was 0 or 1 and survey methods were electrofishing or seine netting were removed. Surveys with area=0 and sampling method trapping or fixed trapping were kept and area set to 1. Records with fished area > 384300 were removed since the values were likely typos (e.g. 9.99 E10, 9.99 E07, etc). 
Final: after these additional curation steps, a few sites monitored only 1 year with unique methods and strategy were removed. Individual counts were pooled (i.e., summed) for each taxon, sampling site and survey. Aggregated individual counts for each taxon were divided by sampled area and multiplied by 100 to obtain units of abundance equal to density in number of ind/100m2. 
Data were split into subsets, each containing records with a unique sampling methodology and strategy. In each resulting study, SampleDescription (i.e., sampling event) is SiteID_Day_Month_Year. The specific methods are indicated in the Methods and Summary Methods description in the metadata. Curation script: U.K._Environmental_Agency_RivFishId27_AFE.R

Together. 20 separate strata exist.With the addition of the fourth strata. the total survey area increased from ~3.626 nauticalmiles (NM2) to ~4.665 NM2. To keep sampling density of the original strata roughlyequivalent with previous surveys. an additional 15 stations were added to the originalgoal of 100 stations per survey. A target of 115 stations is selected for sampling in eachsurvey resulting in a sampling density of 1 station for every 40 NM2. Number of towsper stratum is apportioned according to its total area (Tables 1 and 2).SELECTION OF RANDOM STATIONSRandom stations are selected from a NOAA nautical chart in Arc ViewTM GIS overlainwith 1-NM2 grids. Each grid within each region is assigned a unique identificationnumber that serves as a call number. Grids are selected using an ExcelTM random numbergenerator. Tows approximately 1 NM long are proposed in each grid and plotted in PSeaWindplotTM (using charts of the NAD 1983 datum). From prior experience and localknowledge. some grids are classified as untowable during the plotting process. Due tothe large amount of fixed gear and the appeal to fishermen to cooperate with the surveyby clearing the tows. identifying good tow locations is a priority. If no towable bottomcan be found within a 2-mile radius. a new random number is chosen within the samestratum. Beginning and end points of each tow are identified in P-Sea Windplot. To theextent possible. for ease of identification by lobster industry members. tows follow loranlines. Loran C coordinates are converted to latitude/longitude degrees to the nearest0.001 decimal minutes.2SELECTION OF FIXED STATIONSAfter the initial survey in the fall of 2000. two stations per stratum were designated asfixed stations to be sampled on each subsequent survey. In areas where previous workhad been done. the stations were selected due to their historical importance3. In areas withno history. one station was selected as being roughly representative of the average catchfor its respective stratum and the other was randomly selected. After the addition of thefourth stratum in the spring of 2003. fixed stations were designated for that stratum usingthe same criteria.FISHING GEARTrawl design considerations for the survey include effectiveness of the gear forsampling the complex bottom in the nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine andcomparability with previous and ongoing surveys by NMFS and MassachusettsDivision of Marine Fisheries. The net is a modified version of the shrimp netdesign used in Maine waters (Appendix A). designed to fish for a variety of nearbottomdwelling species without targeting any specific component. RobertTetrault. the vessels? owner. and net designer Jeff Flagg designed the net to fishfeet in length with nominal horsepower. Three identical nets were constructed forthis survey in the event of tearing or loss. Net tapers were cut to permit the shapeof the net to get maximum height while allowing the net to remain tight on thebottom. The net is shackled from the footrope to the frame with two 3/8th inchshackles to a banded wire that runs parallel with the footrope. Heavy rubber wingbobbins retard bottom wing lift at the net end of the bottom leg. Top legs are7/16th wire. 60 feet in length with soft eyes at each end. and bottom legs are 5/8thinch wire. 58 feet in length with two feet of 5/8th inch chain at the end where theleg attaches to the bottom wing for a total of 60 feet. Bottom legs are coveredwith 2 -3/8? cookies to prevent them from digging into the mud. The net isconstructed of 2-inch #24 polyethylene mesh. with a 1-inch (stretched measure)mesh liner in the cod end. Otter boards are #7.5 Bisons. Attached to the 70-foot.5/8th inch Rander?s Combination Wire Rope footrope is a roller frame strung onto?? IPS of 6x19 construction with a fiber core.

The abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids. Labrids. Acanthurids. Serranids. etc.) observed on on a five by fifty meter transect which extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids. Gobiids. Cirrhitids. Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea local time) during late July or early August each year. In 2006. divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides). six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small. stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 15m. those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m.LocationsAnnual fish census locations are labeled with four components in a stratified design: 6 sites. 3 habitats. 4 transects. 2 swaths. (The swaths are the transect widths of 1 m and 5 m.) Therefore there are 144 unique locations surveyed each year. The six MCR-LTER sites span the three shores of the roughly triangular island of Moorea with Sites 1 and 2 on the north-facing shore. Sites 3 and 4 on the south-east-facing shore. and Sites 5 and 6 on the south-west-facing shore. At each site. the three habitats are the Fringing Reef. Backreef. and Forereef. At each habitat. there are four transects. Each transect has two swaths. The two swaths are described in the Diver Observation method step.Dive ConditionsIn addition to the biotic data collected. divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed. wind speed and sea state. swell height in m. amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visibility in m. Dive conditions are recorded for each dive. which is unique to a habitat at a site for a year. Therefore there are 18 unique dive conditions each year (3 habitats at 6 sites).DiversAt each site. at each habitat. there are four transects. each covered by an assigned diver (in 2005 by 2 divers). Whenever possible. the same diver covers the same transect number every year. (Transect 3 has varied.) The diver is listed by their initials. (In 2005. the initials of 2 divers are concatenated.) The diver ID is determined by the year and transect number; there are 4 unique diver IDs for each year.Reference for fish census protocolThe MCR-LTER annual fish census is based on the 'Fish Belt Transect' method described in: 'Methods for Ecological Monitoring Of Coral Reefs: A Resource For Managers.

The Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) is a consortium of State and federal agencies that has been conducting cooperative ecological investigations since the 1970s. The IEP runs over twenty long-term monitoring surveys on biological components of the Upper San Francisco Estuary. Surveys monitor phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, water quality, and many types of fish. Several fish surveys sample zooplankton concurrently, and information on zooplankton species composition and abundance can be coupled with fish diet studies. The IEP long-term surveys that monitor zooplankton are the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP; also known as the IEP zooplankton study), 20-mm Survey (20mm), Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT), Summer Townet Survey (STN), the Yolo Bypass Fisheries Monitoring Survey (not included in this integrated dataset), and the Fish Restoration Program (FRP). An overview of these programs is provided in study_metadata.csv. Locations of fixed sampling locations for surveys with fixed sampling designs are provided in stations.csv, and coordinates for every sample are provided in environment.csv. Zooplankton surveys sample 3 different size classes of zooplankton, by towing nets with different sized mesh (or in one case a pump that pumps water into a microzooplankton net).
Every IEP survey that collects zooplankton samples with a mesozooplankton net, which targets adult copepods and cladocerans, because these taxa are believed to comprise the majority of zooplankton in juvenile and adult planktivorous fish diets. Some surveys also sample with micro- or macro-zooplankton nets. Three size classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers) are targeted with a 43 µm mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 µm mesh nets, and macro zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 µm mesh nets.  
FMWT
 The Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1967 in order to determine the relative abundance and distribution of age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis), but the data has also been used for other upper estuary pelagic fish species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense). The FMWT is currently mandated by the 2019 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion for the coordinated operation of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project (USFWS 2019). The FMWT samples 122 stations each month from September to December ranging from San Pablo Bay to Stockton, Hood, and The Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. FMWT samples both macrozooplankton and mesozooplankton at a subset of these stations since 2011, with some pilot studies in earlier years.
Zooplankton samples are collected along with the fish trawl at fixed stations in open channels using 10-minute oblique tows. Macrozooplankton are sampled using a 124 cm long net with 505 µm mesh, while mesozooplankton is sampled using a 73 cm long modified Clark-Bumpus net with 160 µm mesh. For both zooplankton sizes, samples are preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Lengths are recorded for macrozooplankton but not mesozooplankton, biomass is estimated for both as in EMP. Recorded environmental variables include time, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface and bottom temperature, Secchi depth, Microcystis presence, and turbidity.
More information on FMWT and its methods can be found on the FMWT data publication (Burdi et al. 2022). ","Stations were sampled several times a year.

The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022]

Thus, number of individuals were aggregated per sampling point, sampling operation and taxon and divided by surface area x 100 to obtain density of individuals /100m2. When biomass (weight in g) data were available for all individuals of a taxon sampled in one sampling point and operation, these values were included.

In each site, between 2-8 belt transects were performed. In each transect, fish were recorded along 25X6m belt transects, up to a height of approx. 5m above the substrate. For each transect we used the following protocol: After descending along a rope tied to a pre-deployed buoy,the divers attached a measuring tape to the rope and started swimming. The documentation of the fish started only after 5m of swimming to reduce the interruption caused by the diver descent and preparations for sampling. The two divers documented fish identity and abundance, and estimated fish total length. Fish were identified to species level (excluding Mugilidae, Clupidae and Atherinidae, which are difficult to identify to species level underwater).
